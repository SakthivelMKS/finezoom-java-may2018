BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by his or her height in meters squared. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) now defines normal weight, overweight, and obesity according to BMI rather than the traditional height/weight charts. Overweight is a BMI of 27.3 or more for women and 27.8 or more for men.

bmi = weight/(height in meters)2

BMI = (	            Weight in Kilograms             
(Height in centimeters) x (Height in centimeters)	) x 10,000
